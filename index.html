                Hospitals can be a little nerve-racking when you are sitting on your bed waiting for the 
                surgery to pass by. Even more nerve-racking when a doctor informs you that you could 
                potentially be staying in the ICU. How long will you even be there?! How behind will you be on your classes?!
            </p>

            <p class="caption2 bgtext" >
                No need to worry too much about your ICU stay. There are many people are admitted to the ICU every 
                day, and in some cases, the patients are able to quickly recover and are discharged soon
                after being admitted. 
                
                <br> <br>

                There are many factors that could potentially affect the
                amount of time a person may spend in the ICU. The factors that stand
                out the most are a person's physical attributes and their Preoperative
                Conditions when first being admitted to the ICU. 
            </p>

            <p class="caption3 bgtext">
                We want to answer the following question: 
                
                <br> <br>
                
                Is there a way for patients to be able to predict the length of time they 
                will be staying in the ICU based on their physical state when being admitted?

                <br> <br>

                If a patient can estimate how long they might spend at the ICU, it might help
                them with managing their time over the following days. Patients will know
                how many days to take off work, or gauge the amount of time they will need to 
                spend recovering. Who knows, this project might come in handy for you one day!

                To start, we've created several correlation matrices to see if there are 
                any potential relationships between the important variables present 
                in our dataset.

                <br> <br>

                Orange colors represent negative correlation, and blue colors represent positive
                correlation. The darker the hue, the greater the magnitude, and the lighter colors
                represent smaller magnitudes (close to 0 correlation).
            </p>

            <p class="caption2">
                There are quite a lot of variables, so we split the overall correlation matrix up
                into various sections. This first one dives into the relationship between
                the ICU days and some basic patient information. Feel free to hover over the squares
                to clearly see the measured relationships between the variables.
            </p>

            <p class="caption3">
                Next, we looked at the correlations between the ICU days and the Preoperative
                Conditions of the patients. This one is a lot more messy, and it can be pretty
                difficult to identify exactly what we're looking for.

                <br> <br>

                Don't worry about trying to understand everything present here; in fact, we also got
                quite a headache looking at all this data! In the following few steps, we'll explore
                this data in a more concise manner to help clear things up.
            </p>

            <p class="caption4">
                To start, we've identified a list of variables that have an interesting
                correlation with the number of ICU Days. We've listed them here, along with their correlation.
                
                <br> <br>
                
                You're probably wondering how we decided to choose these values. As such, let's now dive a bit deeper 
                into these variables and take a closer look at why they were selected.

        <h1>Analysis of Correlations</h1>
        <div class="itembox">
            <p class="caption1">
                First, let's take a look at all of the relevant correlations. Since we're trying to
                understand if we can predict the ICU Days, we'll look at all of the correlations that
                relate to the number of ICU Days specifically, as shown here.
            </p>

            <p class="caption2">
                We'll pick out the top 7 features with the highest level of correlation. However, 
                there's more to these features than meets the eye! Do you notice any similarities between some
                of these preoperative conditions?
            </p>

            <p class="caption3">
                Remember, we plotted everything on a correlation matrix. This means that we're able to see
                the correlation between these preoperative conditions! 
                
                <br> <br>

                Some of these features have very high correlations with each other! We've highlighted the ones that 
                correlate with each other in green and red to help you see which ones they are.
            </p>

            <p class="caption4">
                The two relationships that stand out with having an extremely high correlation with each other
                are displayed here, with an extremely high correlation of at least 0.6. This is among the highest 
                correlations in the entire dataset!
                
                <br> <br>

                Trying to predict ICU days with both highly-correlated variables would be redundant, as the information they
                provide our predictions with is quite similar. This principle is called multicollinearity, and it can cause
                problems with our prediction model. Thus, we'll only keep the preoperative condition with a higher correlation 
                with ICU Days (Albumin and AST).
            </p>

            <p class="caption5">
                So far, all of the features with high correlation are preoperative conditions, which is really surprising. 
                We expected more physical features such as age, height, and weight to be relevant as well, but their
                correlations are quite low. Therefore, we'll take a look at these physical features to see if there 
                could be a relationship between them and the ICU Days, and understand why the observed correlation is small!

        <h1>Insight on Physical Attributes</h1>
        <div class="itembox">
            <p class="caption1">
                Here is a distribution of average age when compared to the average ICU Days. For these line plots, feel free to
                hover over them to get some more insight at a specific data point!

                <br> <br>
                We don't really observe a relationship between the two; most of the data
                is concentrated in older patients (ages 30 - 80), and all of them are somewhat similar, having
                a mean ICU Stay length of around 0.4 or 0.5 Days. 

                <br> <br>

                The high values in the lower and higher ages are mostly outliers, since there were
                very few patients recorded with these ages.
            </p>

            <p class="caption2">
                Here is a distribution of height when compared to average ICU Days. 

                <br> <br>

                Most of the data here is located in the 145 - 180 cm range. Again, the average ICU Days in this range
                does not change much depending on the age, which makes sense given the low correlation value observed. 

                <br> <br>

                There are some outliers, specifically for patients with low heights. Although this may be relevant for determining
                potential relationships, there simply isn't enough data regarding these values, leading to the low correlation.
            </p>

            <p class="caption3">
                Here is a distribution of weight when compared to average ICU Days. 
                
                <br> <br>

                The distribution here is very similar to what we noticed with the height, with most of the data located in the
                40 - 90 kg range, and there doesn't appear to be any patterns here. 
                
                <br> <br>

                However, we again notice that there are a few patients with low weights, and they have long ICU stays. 
                Although this could hint at some kind of relationship existing, this explains why the correlation
                value we calculated won't be very high, because the amount of low outliers are quite little.

        <h1>Important Findings</h1>
        <div class="itemboxbg">
            <p class="caption1 bgtext" >
                Our work so far has given us a list of some important Preoperative Conditions that may
                correlate with ICU Days.
                
                <br> <br>

                To Recap: The main factors that we found had high correlation with ICU Days and not with 
                another preoperative condition were Albumin, AST, aPTT, and Sodium. Based on these chosen values, 
                we might be able to predict the length of a patient's potential ICU stay.

            </p>

            <p class="caption2 bgtext">
                There are also some physical factors that we found were not as relevant. This was a surprising discovery
                for us, since we expected to see a high correlation between age, height, and weight and the ICU Days. 
                
                <br> <br>
                
                Of these features, height had the strongest correlation, but it's still not extremely relevant when it comes to 
                making predictions, according to our calculations. 
                However, this result could be due to limitations in our dataset - further study could yield some more interesting findings!
            </p>

            <p class="caption3 bgtext">
                For now though, why don't we try to make a simple linear regression model using the relevant
                features that we found? Let's see how it looks!
