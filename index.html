                Many people are admitted to the ICU every day. In some cases,
                the patients are able to quickly recover and are discharged soon
                after being admitted. 
                
                <br> <br>

                There are many factors that could be potential factors for the 
                amount of time a person may spend in the ICU. The factors that stand
                out the most are a person's physical attributes and their Preoperative
                Conditions when first being admitted to the ICU. 
            </p>

            <p class="caption2 bgtext">
                We want to answer the following question: 
                
                <br> <br>
                
                Is there a way for patients to be able to predict the length of time they 
                will be staying in the ICU based on their physical state when being admitted?

                <br> <br>

                If a patient can estimate how long they might spend at the ICU, it might help
                them with managing their time over the following days. Patients will know
                how many days to take off work, or gauge the amount of time they will need to 
                spend recovering.

                To start, we've created several correlation matrices to see if there are 
                any potential relationships between the important variables present 
                in our dataset.
            </p>

            <p class="caption2">
                There are quite a lot of variables, so we split the overall correlation matrix up
                into various sections. This first one dives into the relationship between
                the ICU days and some basic patient information. Feel free to hover over a square
                to better see which variables are being measured.
            </p>

            <p class="caption3">
                Next, we looked at the correlations between the ICU days and the Preoperative
                Conditions of the patients. This one is a lot more messy, and it can be pretty
                difficult to identify exactly what we're looking for.
            </p>

            <p class="caption4">
                To start, we've identified a list of variables that have an interesting
                correlation with the ICU Days. Now, let's dive a bit deeper into these variables
                and take a closer look at them and why they were chosen in the upcoming section.

        <div class="itembox">
            <p class="caption1">
                First, let's take a look at all of the relevant correlations. Since we're trying to
                understand if we can predict the ICU Days, we'll look at all of the correlations that
                have to do with this.
            </p>

            <p class="caption2">
                We'll pick out the top 7 features with the highest correlation. However, there's more to
                these features than meets the eye at first glance!
            </p>

            <p class="caption3">
                Remember, we plotted everything on a correlation matrix. This means that we're able to see
                the correlation between these preoperative conditions! And some of these features have very
                high correlations with each other!
            </p>

            <p class="caption4">
                The two relationships that stand out with having an extremely high correlation with each other
                are displayed here, with an extremely high correlation of at least 0.6. This is among the highest
                correlations in the entire data! Since trying to predict ICU days with both of these variables
                would be redundant, we'll only keep the preoperative condition with a higher correlation with ICU Days.
            </p>

            <p class="caption5">
                It seems like all of these are preoperative conditions, which is interesting. We thought we'd
                see more physical features such as age, height, and weight to be relevant - so next, 
                we'll take a look at those to see if there really is a correlation between them and the ICU Days!

                Here is a distribution of age when compared to the average ICU Days. Here,
                we don't really observe a relationship between the two, since both high and 
                low ages see long ICU stays, while most of the middle ages stays consistently
                at similar values.
            </p>

            <p class="caption2">
                Here is a distribution of height when compared to average ICU Days. The distribution
                does look like there is a slight relationship, which makes sense given the higher
                correlation compared to before. However, the relationship still isn't very strong.
            </p>

            <p class="caption3">
                Here is a distribution of weight when compared to average ICU Days. Similarly to height,
                the distribution has a slight relationship. However, the correlation is still pretty low,
                so it seems like weight doesn't have a strong relationship with ICU stay length.

        <h1>Important Findings</h1>
        <div class="itemboxbg">
            <p class="caption1 bgtext" >
                Now, we have a list of some important Preoperative Conditions that may
                correlate with ICU Days.
                
                <br> <br>

                The main factors that we found had high correlation with ICU Days and not with 
                another preoperative condition were Albumin, AST, aPTT, and Sodium. Based on these values, 
                we might be able to predict the length of a patient's potential length of ICU stay.

            </p>

            <p class="caption2 bgtext">
                There are also some physical factors that we found were not as relevant.
                
                <br> <br>
                
                Specifically, it appears like age, height, and weight aren't very relevant
                to the length of a patient's ICU stay. Of these features, height plays the biggest
                factor, but it's still not extremely relevant when it comes to making predictions.
            </p>

            <p class="caption3 bgtext">
                Why don't we try to make a simple linear regression models using the relevant
                features that we found? Let's see how it looks!
